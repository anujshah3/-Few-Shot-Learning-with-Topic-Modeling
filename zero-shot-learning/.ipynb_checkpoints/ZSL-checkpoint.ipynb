An entity shall apply this Standard, including the use of any practical expedients, consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances.

For example, this Standard would not apply to a contract between two oil companies that agree to an exchange of oil to fulfil demand from their customers in different specified locations on a timely basis. An entity shall apply this Standard to a contract (other than a contract listed in paragraph 5) only if the counterparty to the contract is a customer. A customer is a party that has contracted with an entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the entity’s ordinary activities in exchange for consideration. A counterparty to the contract would not be a customer if, for example, the counterparty has contracted with the entity to participate in an activity or process in which the parties to the contract share in the risks and benefits that result from the activity or process (such as developing an asset in a collaboration arrangement) rather than to obtain the output of the entity’s ordinary activities. A contract with a customer may be partially within the scope of this Standard and partially within the scope of other Standards listed in paragraph 5. (a) If the other Standards specify how to separate and/or initially measure one or more parts of the contract, then an entity shall first apply the separation and/or measurement requirements in those Standards. An entity shall exclude from the transaction price the amount of the part (or parts) of the contract that are initially measured in accordance with other Standards and shall apply paragraphs 73 –86 to allocate the amount of the transaction price that remains (if any) to each performance obligation within the scope of this Standard and to any other parts of the contract identified by paragraph 7(b). (b) If the other Standards do not specify how to separate and/or initially measure one or more parts of the contract, then the entity shall apply this Standard to separate and/or initially measure the part (or parts) of the contract. This Standard specifies the accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and for the costs incurred to fulfil a contract with a customer if those costs are not within the scope of another Standard (see paragraphs 91 –104 ).

In evaluating whether collectability of an amount of consideration is probable, an entity shall consider only the customer’s ability and intention to pay that amount of consideration when it is due. The amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled may be less than the price stated in the contract if the consideration is variable because the entity may offer the customer a price concession (see paragraph 52). A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. Enforceability of the rights and obligations in a contract is a matter of law. Contracts can be written, oral or implied by an entity’s customary business practices. The practices and processes for establishing contracts with customers vary across legal jurisdictions, industries and entities. In addition, they may vary within an entity (for example, they may depend on the class of customer or the nature of the promised goods or services). An entity shall consider those practices and processes in determining whether and when an agreement with a customer creates enforceable rights and obligations. Some contracts with customers may have no fixed duration and can be terminated or modified by either party at any time. Other contracts may automatically renew on a periodic basis that is specified in the contract. An entity shall apply this Standard to the duration of the contract (ie the contractual period) in which the parties to the contract have present enforceable rights and obligations. For the purpose of applying this Standard, a contract does not exist if each party to the contract has the unilateral enforceable right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party (or parties). A contract is wholly unperformed if both of the following criteria are met: (a) the entity has not yet transferred any promised goods or services to the customer; and (b) the entity has not yet received, and is not yet entitled to receive, any consideration in exchange for promised goods or services. If a contract with a customer meets the criteria in paragraph 9 at contract inception, an entity shall not reassess those criteria unless there is an indication of a significant change in facts and circumstances. For example, if a customer’s ability to pay the consideration deteriorates significantly, an entity would reassess whether it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for the remaining goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. If a contract with a customer does not meet the criteria in paragraph 9, an entity shall continue to assess the contract to determine whether the criteria in paragraph 9 are subsequently met. When a contract with a customer does not meet the criteria in paragraph 9 and an entity receives consideration from the customer, the entity shall recognise the consideration received as revenue only when either of the following events has occurred: (a) the entity has no remaining obligations to transfer goods or services to the customer and all, or substantially all, of the consideration promised by the customer has been received by the entity and is non- refundable; or (b) the contract has been terminated and the consideration received from the customer is non-refundable. An entity shall recognise the consideration received from a customer as a liability until one of the events in paragraph 15 occurs or until the criteria in paragraph 9 are subsequently met (see paragraph 14). Depending on the facts and circumstances relating to the contract , the liability recognised represents the entity’s obligation to either transfer goods or services in the future or refund the consideration received. In either case, the liability shall be measured at the amount of consideration received from the customer.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'A contract modification is a change in the scope or price (or both) of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. In some industries and jurisdictions, a contract modification may be described as a change order, a variation or an amendment. A contract modification exists when the parties to a contract approve a modification that either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. A contract modification could be approved in writing, by oral agreement or implied by customary business practices. If the parties to the contract have not approved a contract modification, an entity shall continue to apply this Standard to the existing contract until the contract modification is approved. A contract modification may exist even though the parties to the contract have a dispute about the scope or price (or both) of the modification or the parties have approved a change in the scope of the contract but have not yet determined the corresponding change in price. In determining whether the rights and obligations that are created or changed by a modification are enforceable, an entity shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances including the terms of the contract and other evidence. If the parties to a contract have approved a change in the scope of the contract but have not yet determined the corresponding change in price, an entity shall estimate the change to the transaction price arising from the modification in accordance with paragraphs 50 –54 on estimating variable consideration and paragraphs 56–58 on constraining estimates of variable consideration. An entity shall account for a contract modification as a separate contract if both of the following conditions are present: (a) the scope of the contract increases because of the addition of promised goods or services that are distinct (in accordance with paragraphs 26–30); and (b) the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that reflects the entity’s stand-alone selling prices of the additional promised goods or services and any appropriate adjustments to that price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract. For example, an entity may adjust the stand-alone selling price of an additional good or service for a discount that the customer receives, because it is not necessary for the entity to incur the selling-related costs that it would incur when selling a similar good or service to a new customer. If a contract modification is not accounted for as a separate contract in accordance with paragraph 20, an entity shall account for the promised goods or services not yet transferred at the date of the contract modification (ie the remaining promised goods or services) in whichever of the following ways is applicable: (a) An entity shall account for the contract modification as if it were a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract, if the remaining goods or services are distinct from the goods or services transferred on or before the date of the contract modification. The amount of consideration to be allocated to the remaining performance obligations (or to the remaining distinct goods or services in a single performance obligation identified in accordance with paragraph 22(b)) is the sum of: (i) the consideration promised by the customer (including amounts already received from the customer) that was included in the estimate of the transaction price and that had not been recognised as revenue; and (ii) the consideration promised as part of the contract modification. (b) An entity shall account for the contract modification as if it were a part of the existing contract if the remaining goods or services are not distinct and, therefore, form part of a single performance obligation that is partially satisfied at the date of the contract modification. The effect that the contract modification has on the transaction price, and on the entity’s measure of progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, is recognised as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) at the date of the contract modification (ie the adjustment to revenue is made on a cumulative catch-up basis). (c) If the remaining goods or services are a combination of items (a) and (b), then the entity shall account for the effects of the modification on the unsatisfied (including partially unsatisfied) performance obligations in the modified contract in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of this paragraph.'},\n",

       "  'Tag': 'Identifying performance obligations',\n",
       "  'data': 'At contract inception, an entity shall assess the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer and shall identify as a performance obligation each promise to transfer to the customer either: (a) a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct; or (b) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer (see paragraph 23). A series of distinct goods or services has the same pattern of transfer to the customer if both of the following criteria are met: (a) each distinct good or service in the series that the entity promises to transfer to the customer would meet the criteria in paragraph 35 to be a performance obligation satisfied over time; and (b) in accordance with paragraphs 39–40 , the same method would be used to measure the entity’s progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation to transfer each distinct good or service in the series to the customer. Promises in contracts with customers A contract with a customer generally explicitly states the goods or services that an entity promises to transfer to a customer. However, the performance obligations identified in a contract with a customer may not be limited to the goods or services that are explicitly stated in that contract. This is because a contract with a customer may also include promises that are implied by an entity’s customary business practices, published policies or specific statements if, at the time of entering into the contract, those promises create a valid expectation of the customer that the entity will transfer a good or service to the customer. Performance obligations do not include activities that an entity must undertake to fulfil a contract unless those activities transfer a good or service to a customer. For example, a services provider may need to perform various administrative tasks to set up a contract. The performance of those tasks does not transfer a service to the customer as the tasks are performed. Therefore, those setup activities are not a performance obligation. Distinct goods or services Depending on the contract , promised goods or services may include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) sale of goods produced by an entity (for example, inventory of a manufacturer); (b) resale of goods purchased by an entity (for example, merchandise of a retailer); (c) resale of rights to goods or services purchased by an entity (for example, a ticket resold by an entity acting as a principal, as described in paragraphs B34–B38); (d) performing a contractually agreed-upon task (or tasks) for a customer; (e) providing a service of standing ready to provide goods or services (for example, unspecified updates to software that are provided on a when- and-if-available basis) or of making goods or services available for a customer to use as and when the customer decides; (f) providing a service of arranging for another party to transfer goods or services to a customer (for example, acting as an agent of another party, as described in paragraphs B34–B38); (g) granting rights to goods or services to be provided in the future that a customer can resell or provide to its customer (for example, an entity selling a product to a retailer promises to transfer an additional good or service to an individual who purchases the product from the retailer); (h) constructing, manufacturing or developing an asset on behalf of a customer; (i) granting licences (see paragraphs B52–B63B); and (j) granting options to purchase additional goods or services (when those options provide a customer with a material right, as described in paragraphs B39–B43). A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if both of the following criteria are met: (a) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (ie the good or service is capable of being distinct); and (b) the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (ie the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). A customer can benefit from a good or service in accordance with paragraph 27(a) if the good or service could be used, consumed, sold for an amount that is greater than scrap value or otherwise held in a way that generates economic benefits. For some goods or services, a customer may be able to benefit from a good or service on its own. For other goods or services, a customer may be able to benefit from the good or service only in conjunction with other readily available resources. A readily available resource is a good or service that is sold separately (by the entity or another entity) or a resource that the customer has already obtained from the entity (including goods or services that the entity will have already transferred to the customer under the contract ) or from other transactions or events. Various factors may provide evidence that the customer can benefit from a good or service either on its own or in conjunction with other readily available resources. For example, the fact that the entity regularly sells a good or service separately would indicate that a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other readily available resources. In assessing whether an entity’s promises to transfer goods or services to the customer are separately identifiable in accordance with paragraph 27(b), the objective is to determine whether the nature of the promise, within the context of the contract , is to transfer each of those goods or services individually or, instead, to transfer a combined item or items to which the promised goods or services are inputs. Factors that indicate that two or more promises to transfer goods or services to a customer are not separately identifiable include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) the entity provides a significant service of integrating the goods or services with other goods or services promised in the contract into a bundle of goods or services that represent the combined output or outputs for which the customer has contracted. In other words, the entity is using the goods or services as inputs to produce or deliver the combined output or outputs specified by the customer. A combined output or outputs might include more than one phase, element or unit. (b) one or more of the goods or services significantly modifies or customises, or are significantly modified or customised by, one or more of the other goods or services promised in the contract. (c) the goods or services are highly interdependent or highly interrelated. In other words, each of the goods or services is significantly affected by one or more of the other goods or services in the contract. For example, in some cases, two or more goods or services are significantly affected by each other because the entity would not be able to fulfil its promise by transferring each of the goods or services independently. If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity shall combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct. In some cases, that would result in the entity accounting for all the goods or services promised in a contract as a single performance obligation.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'An entity shall recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service (ie an asset) to a customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that asset. For each performance obligation identified in accordance with paragraphs 22 –30, an entity shall determine at contract inception whether it satisfies the performance obligation over time (in accordance with paragraphs 35 –37) or satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time (in accordance with paragraph 38). If an entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. Goods and services are assets, even if only momentarily, when they are received and used (as in the case of many services). Control of an asset refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset. Control includes the ability to prevent other entities from directing the use of, and obtaining the benefits from, an asset. The benefits of an asset are the potential cash flows (inflows or savings in outflows) that can be obtained directly or indirectly in many ways, such as by: (a) using the asset to produce goods or provide services (including public services); (b) using the asset to enhance the value of other assets; (c) using the asset to settle liabilities or reduce expenses; (d) selling or exchanging the asset; (e) pledging the asset to secure a loan; and (f) holding the asset. When evaluating whether a customer obtains control of an asset, an entity shall consider any agreement to repurchase the asset (see paragraphs B64–B76). Performance obligations satisfied over time An entity transfers control of a good or service over time and, therefore, satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met: (a) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (see paragraphs B3–B4); (b) the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in progress) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (see paragraph B5); or (c) the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see paragraph 36) and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (see paragraph 37). An asset created by an entity’s performance does not have an alternative use to an entity if the entity is either restricted contractually from readily directing the asset for another use during the creation or enhancement of that asset or limited practically from readily directing the asset in its completed state for another use. The assessment of whether an asset has an alternative use to the entity is made at contract inception. After contract inception, an entity shall not update the assessment of the alternative use of an asset unless the parties to the contract approve a contract modification that substantively changes the performance obligation. Paragraphs B6 –B8 provide guidance for assessing whether an asset has an alternative use to an entity. An entity shall consider the terms of the contract , as well as any laws that apply to the contract, when evaluating whether it has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date in accordance with paragraph 35(c). The right to payment for performance completed to date does not need to be for a fixed amount. However, at all times throughout the duration of the contract, the entity must be entitled to an amount that at least compensates the entity for performance completed to date if the contract is terminated by the customer or another party for reasons other than the entity’s failure to perform as promised. Paragraphs B9 –B13 provide guidance for assessing the existence and enforceability of a right to payment and whether an entity’s right to payment would entitle the entity to be paid for its performance completed to date. Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time If a performance obligation is not satisfied over time in accordance with paragraphs 35 –37, an entity satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity shall consider the requirements for control in paragraphs 31 –34. In addition, an entity shall consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) The entity has a present right to payment for the asset—if a customer is presently obliged to pay for an asset, then that may indicate that the customer has obtained the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset in exchange. (b) The customer has legal title to the asset—legal title may indicate which party to a contract has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, an asset or to restrict the access of other entities to those benefits. Therefore, the transfer of legal title of an asset may indicate that the customer has obtained control of the asset. If an entity retains legal title solely as protection against the customer’s failure to pay, those rights of the entity would not preclude the customer from obtaining control of an asset. (c) The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset—the customer’s physical possession of an asset may indicate that the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset or to restrict the access of other entities to those benefits. However, physical possession may not coincide with control of an asset. For example, in some repurchase agreements and in some consignment arrangements, a customer or consignee may have physical possession of an asset that the entity controls. Conversely, in some bill-and-hold arrangements, the entity may have physical possession of an asset that the customer controls. Paragraphs B64 –B76 , B77–B78 and B79–B82 provide guidance on accounting for repurchase agreements, consignment arrangements and bill-and-hold arrangements, respectively. (d) The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset—the transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the customer may indicate that the customer has obtained the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset. However, when evaluating the risks and rewards of ownership of a promised asset, an entity shall exclude any risks that give rise to a separate performance obligation in addition to the performance obligation to transfer the asset. For example, an entity may have transferred control of an asset to a customer but not yet satisfied an additional performance obligation to provide maintenance services related to the transferred asset. (e) The customer has accepted the asset—the customer’s acceptance of an asset may indicate that it has obtained the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset. To evaluate the effect of a contractual customer acceptance clause on when control of an asset is transferred, an entity shall consider the guidance in paragraphs B83–B86.IFRS 15  Measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation For each performance obligation satisfied over time in accordance with paragraphs 35 –37, an entity shall recognise revenue over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. The objective when measuring progress is to depict an entity’s performance in transferring control of goods or services promised to a customer (ie the satisfaction of an entity’s performance obligation). An entity shall apply a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time and the entity shall apply that method consistently to similar performance obligations and in similar circumstances. At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall remeasure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation satisfied over time. Methods for measuring progress Appropriate methods of measuring progress include output methods and input methods. Paragraphs B14 –B19 provide guidance for using output methods and input methods to measure an entity’s progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation. In determining the appropriate method for measuring progress, an entity shall consider the nature of the good or service that the entity promised to transfer to the customer. When applying a method for measuring progress, an entity shall exclude from the measure of progress any goods or services for which the entity does not transfer control to a customer. Conversely, an entity shall include in the measure of progress any goods or services for which the entity does transfer control to a customer when satisfying that performance obligation. As circumstances change over time, an entity shall update its measure of progress to reflect any changes in the outcome of the performance obligation. Such changes to an entity’s measure of progress shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Reasonable measures of progress An entity shall recognise revenue for a performance obligation satisfied over time only if the entity can reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. An entity would not be able to reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation if it lacks reliable information that would be required to apply an appropriate method of measuring progress. In some circumstances (for example, in the early stages of a contract ), an entity may not be able to reasonably measure the outcome of a performance obligation , but the entity expects to recover the costs incurred in satisfying the performance obligation. In those circumstances, the entity shall recognise revenue only to the extent of the costs incurred until such time that it can reasonably measure the outcome of the performance obligation.'},\n",

The asset may relate to goods or services to be transferred under a specific anticipated contract (as described in paragraph 95(a)). An entity shall update the amortisation to reflect a significant change in the entity’s expected timing of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Such a change shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8. An entity shall recognise an impairment loss in profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of an asset recognised in accordance with paragraph 91 or 95 exceeds: (a) the remaining amount of consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services to which the asset relates; less (b) the costs that relate directly to providing those goods or services and that have not been recognised as expenses (see paragraph 97). For the purposes of applying paragraph 101 to determine the amount of consideration that an entity expects to receive, an entity shall use the principles for determining the transaction price (except for the requirements in paragraphs 56 –58 on constraining estimates of variable consideration) and adjust that amount to reflect the effects of the customer’s credit risk. Before an entity recognises an impairment loss for an asset recognised in accordance with paragraph 91 or 95, the entity shall recognise any impairment loss for assets related to the contract that are recognised in accordance with another Standard (for example, IAS 2, IAS 16 and IAS 38 ).

An entity shall recognise in profit or loss a reversal of some or all of an impairment loss previously recognised in accordance with paragraph 101 when the impairment conditions no longer exist or have improved.

       "  'data': 'When either party to a contract has performed, an entity shall present the contract in the statement of financial position as a contract asset or a contract liability, depending on the relationship between the entity’s performance and the customer’s payment. An entity shall present any unconditional rights to consideration separately as a receivable. If a customer pays consideration, or an entity has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (ie a receivable), before the entity transfers a good or service to the customer, the entity shall present the contract as a contract liability when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). A contract liability is an entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If an entity performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, the entity shall present the contract as a contract asset , excluding any amounts presented as a receivable. A contract asset is an entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer. An entity shall assess a contract asset for impairment in accordance with IFRS 9. An impairment of a contract asset shall be measured, presented and disclosed on the same basis as a financial asset that is within the scope of IFRS 9 (see also paragraph 113(b)). A receivable is an entity’s right to consideration that is unconditional. A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due. For example, an entity would recognise a receivable if it has a present right to payment even though that amount may be subject to refund in the future. An entity shall account for a receivable in accordance with IFRS 9. Upon initial recognition of a receivable from a contract with a customer , any difference between the measurement of the receivable in accordance with IFRS 9 and the corresponding amount of revenue recognised shall be presented as an expense (for example, as an impairment loss). This Standard uses the terms ‘contract asset’ and ‘contract liability’ but does not prohibit an entity from using alternative descriptions in the statement of financial position for those items.

An entity shall apply this Standard to a contract ( other than a contract listed in paragraph 5 ) only if the counterparty to the contract is a customer . A customer is a party that has contracted with an entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the entity ’s ordinary activities in exchange for consideration .

In evaluating whether collectability of an amount of consideration is probable , an entity shall consider only the customer ’s ability and intention to pay that amount of consideration when it is due . The amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled may be less than the price stated in the contract if the consideration is variable because the entity may offer the customer a price concession ( see paragraph 52 ) . A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations . Enforceability of the rights and obligations in a contract is a matter of law . Contracts can be written , oral or implied by an entity ’s customary business practices .

In addition , they may vary within an entity ( for example , they may depend on the class of customer or the nature of the promised goods or services ) . An entity shall consider those practices and processes in determining whether and when an agreement with a customer creates enforceable rights and obligations . Some contracts with customers may have no fixed duration and can be terminated or modified by either party at any time . Other contracts may automatically renew on a periodic basis that is specified in the contract . An entity shall apply this Standard to the duration of the contract ( ie the contractual period ) in which the parties to the contract have present enforceable rights and obligations . For the purpose of applying this Standard , a contract does not exist if each party to the contract has the unilateral enforceable right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party ( or parties ) . A contract is wholly unperformed if both of the following criteria are met : ( a ) the entity has not yet transferred any promised goods or services to the customer ; and ( b ) the entity has not yet received , and is not yet entitled to receive , any consideration in exchange for promised goods or services . If a contract with a customer meets the criteria in paragraph 9 at contract inception , an entity shall not reassess those criteria unless there is an indication of a significant change in facts and circumstances . For example , if a customer ’s ability to pay the consideration deteriorates significantly , an entity would reassess whether it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for the remaining goods or services that will be transferred to the customer . If a contract with a customer does not meet the criteria in paragraph 9 , an entity shall continue to assess the contract to determine whether the criteria in paragraph 9 are subsequently met . When a contract with a customer does not meet the criteria in paragraph 9 and an entity receives consideration from the customer , the entity shall recognise the consideration received as revenue only when either of the following events has occurred : ( a ) the entity has no remaining obligations to transfer goods or services to the customer and all , or substantially all , of the consideration promised by the customer has been received by the entity and is non - refundable ; or ( b ) the contract has been terminated and the consideration received from the customer is non-refundable . An entity shall recognise the consideration received from a customer as a liability until one of the events in paragraph 15 occurs or until the criteria in paragraph 9 are subsequently met ( see paragraph 14 ) . Depending on the facts and circumstances relating to the contract , the liability recognised represents the entity ’s obligation to either transfer goods or services in the future or refund the consideration received . In either case , the liability shall be measured at the amount of consideration received from the customer .\"\n"

      "Combination of contracts\n",
      "Sentence: \"An entity shall combine two or more contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same customer ( or related parties of the customer ) and account for the contracts as a single contract if one or more of the following criteria are met : ( a ) the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective ; ( b ) the amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract ; or ( c ) the goods or services promised in the contracts ( or some goods or services promised in each of the contracts ) are a single performance obligation in accordance with paragraphs 22 – 30 .\"\n",
      "Contract modifications\n",
      "Sentence: \"A contract modification is a change in the scope or price ( or both ) of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract . In some industries and jurisdictions , a contract modification may be described as a change order , a variation or an amendment . A contract modification exists when the parties to a contract approve a modification that either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations of the parties to the contract . A contract modification could be approved in writing , by oral agreement or implied by customary business practices . If the parties to the contract have not approved a contract modification , an entity shall continue to apply this Standard to the existing contract until the contract modification is approved . A contract modification may exist even though the parties to the contract have a dispute about the scope or price ( or both ) of the modification or the parties have approved a change in the scope of the contract but have not yet determined the corresponding change in price . In determining whether the rights and obligations that are created or changed by a modification are enforceable , an entity shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances including the terms of the contract and other evidence . If the parties to a contract have approved a change in the scope of the contract but have not yet determined the corresponding change in price , an entity shall estimate the change to the transaction price arising from the modification in accordance with paragraphs 50 – 54 on estimating variable consideration and paragraphs 56 – 58 on constraining estimates of variable consideration . An entity shall account for a contract modification as a separate contract if both of the following conditions are present : ( a ) the scope of the contract increases because of the addition of promised goods or services that are distinct ( in accordance with paragraphs 26 – 30 ) ; and ( b ) the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that reflects the entity ’s stand-alone selling prices of the additional promised goods or services and any appropriate adjustments to that price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract . For example , an entity may adjust the stand-alone selling price of an additional good or service for a discount that the customer receives , because it is not necessary for the entity to incur the selling-related costs that it would incur when selling a similar good or service to a new customer . If a contract modification is not accounted for as a separate contract in accordance with paragraph 20 , an entity shall account for the promised goods or services not yet transferred at the date of the contract modification ( ie the remaining promised goods or services ) in whichever of the following ways is applicable : ( a ) An entity shall account for the contract modification as if it were a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract , if the remaining goods or services are distinct from the goods or services transferred on or before the date of the contract modification . The amount of consideration to be allocated to the remaining performance obligations ( or to the remaining distinct goods or services in a single performance obligation identified in accordance with paragraph 22 ( b )) is the sum of : ( i ) the consideration promised by the customer ( including amounts already received from the customer ) that was included in the estimate of the transaction price and that had not been recognised as revenue ; and ( ii ) the consideration promised as part of the contract modification . ( b ) An entity shall account for the contract modification as if it were a part of the existing contract if the remaining goods or services are not distinct and , therefore , form part of a single performance obligation that is partially satisfied at the date of the contract modification . The effect that the contract modification has on the transaction price , and on the entity ’s measure of progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation , is recognised as an adjustment to revenue ( either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue ) at the date of the contract modification ( ie the adjustment to revenue is made on a cumulative catch-up basis ) . ( c ) If the remaining goods or services are a combination of items ( a ) and ( b ) , then the entity shall account for the effects of the modification on the unsatisfied ( including partially unsatisfied ) performance obligations in the modified contract in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of this paragraph .\" → Contract modifications (0.5903)\n",
      "Identifying performance obligations\n",
      "Sentence: \"At contract inception , an entity shall assess the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer and shall identify as a performance obligation each promise to transfer to the customer either : ( a ) a good or service ( or a bundle of goods or services ) that is distinct ; or ( b ) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer ( see paragraph 23 ) . A series of distinct goods or services has the same pattern of transfer to the customer if both of the following criteria are met : ( a ) each distinct good or service in the series that the entity promises to transfer to the customer would meet the criteria in paragraph 35 to be a performance obligation satisfied over time ; and ( b ) in accordance with paragraphs 39 – 40 , the same method would be used to measure the entity ’s progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation to transfer each distinct good or service in the series to the customer . Promises in contracts with customers A contract with a customer generally explicitly states the goods or services that an entity promises to transfer to a customer . However , the performance obligations identified in a contract with a customer may not be limited to the goods or services that are explicitly stated in that contract . This is because a contract with a customer may also include promises that are implied by an entity ’s customary business practices , published policies or specific statements if , at the time of entering into the contract , those promises create a valid expectation of the customer that the entity will transfer a good or service to the customer . Performance obligations do not include activities that an entity must undertake to fulfil a contract unless those activities transfer a good or service to a customer . For example , a services provider may need to perform various administrative tasks to set up a contract . The performance of those tasks does not transfer a service to the customer as the tasks are performed . Therefore , those setup activities are not a performance obligation . Distinct goods or services Depending on the contract , promised goods or services may include , but are not limited to , the following : ( a ) sale of goods produced by an entity ( for example , inventory of a manufacturer ) ; ( b ) resale of goods purchased by an entity ( for example , merchandise of a retailer ) ; ( c ) resale of rights to goods or services purchased by an entity ( for example , a ticket resold by an entity acting as a principal , as described in paragraphs B34 – B38 ) ; ( d ) performing a contractually agreed-upon task ( or tasks ) for a customer ; ( e ) providing a service of standing ready to provide goods or services ( for example , unspecified updates to software that are provided on a when - and-if-available basis ) or of making goods or services available for a customer to use as and when the customer decides ; ( f ) providing a service of arranging for another party to transfer goods or services to a customer ( for example , acting as an agent of another party , as described in paragraphs B34 – B38 ) ; ( g ) granting rights to goods or services to be provided in the future that a customer can resell or provide to its customer ( for example , an entity selling a product to a retailer promises to transfer an additional good or service to an individual who purchases the product from the retailer ) ; ( h ) constructing , manufacturing or developing an asset on behalf of a customer ; ( i ) granting licences ( see paragraphs B52 – B63B ) ; and ( j ) granting options to purchase additional goods or services ( when those options provide a customer with a material right , as described in paragraphs B39 – B43 ) . A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if both of the following criteria are met : ( a ) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer ( ie the good or service is capable of being distinct ) ; and ( b ) the entity ’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract ( ie the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract ) . A customer can benefit from a good or service in accordance with paragraph 27 ( a ) if the good or service could be used , consumed , sold for an amount that is greater than scrap value or otherwise held in a way that generates economic benefits . For some goods or services , a customer may be able to benefit from a good or service on its own . For other goods or services , a customer may be able to benefit from the good or service only in conjunction with other readily available resources . A readily available resource is a good or service that is sold separately ( by the entity or another entity ) or a resource that the customer has already obtained from the entity ( including goods or services that the entity will have already transferred to the customer under the contract ) or from other transactions or events . Various factors may provide evidence that the customer can benefit from a good or service either on its own or in conjunction with other readily available resources . For example , the fact that the entity regularly sells a good or service separately would indicate that a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other readily available resources . In assessing whether an entity ’s promises to transfer goods or services to the customer are separately identifiable in accordance with paragraph 27 ( b ) , the objective is to determine whether the nature of the promise , within the context of the contract , is to transfer each of those goods or services individually or , instead , to transfer a combined item or items to which the promised goods or services are inputs . Factors that indicate that two or more promises to transfer goods or services to a customer are not separately identifiable include , but are not limited to , the following : ( a ) the entity provides a significant service of integrating the goods or services with other goods or services promised in the contract into a bundle of goods or services that represent the combined output or outputs for which the customer has contracted . In other words , the entity is using the goods or services as inputs to produce or deliver the combined output or outputs specified by the customer . A combined output or outputs might include more than one phase , element or unit . ( b ) one or more of the goods or services significantly modifies or customises , or are significantly modified or customised by , one or more of the other goods or services promised in the contract . ( c ) the goods or services are highly interdependent or highly interrelated . In other words , each of the goods or services is significantly affected by one or more of the other goods or services in the contract . For example , in some cases , two or more goods or services are significantly affected by each other because the entity would not be able to fulfil its promise by transferring each of the goods or services independently . If a promised good or service is not distinct , an entity shall combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct . In some cases , that would result in the entity accounting for all the goods or services promised in a contract as a single performance obligation .\"\n"

      "Satisfaction of performance obligations\n",
      "Sentence: \"An entity shall recognise revenue when ( or as ) the entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service ( ie an asset ) to a customer . An asset is transferred when ( or as ) the customer obtains control of that asset . For each performance obligation identified in accordance with paragraphs 22 – 30 , an entity shall determine at contract inception whether it satisfies the performance obligation over time ( in accordance with paragraphs 35 – 37 ) or satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time ( in accordance with paragraph 38 ) . If an entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time , the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time . Goods and services are assets , even if only momentarily , when they are received and used ( as in the case of many services ) . Control of an asset refers to the ability to direct the use of , and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from , the asset . Control includes the ability to prevent other entities from directing the use of , and obtaining the benefits from , an asset . The benefits of an asset are the potential cash flows ( inflows or savings in outflows ) that can be obtained directly or indirectly in many ways , such as by : ( a ) using the asset to produce goods or provide services ( including public services ) ; ( b ) using the asset to enhance the value of other assets ; ( c ) using the asset to settle liabilities or reduce expenses ; ( d ) selling or exchanging the asset ; ( e ) pledging the asset to secure a loan ; and ( f ) holding the asset . When evaluating whether a customer obtains control of an asset , an entity shall consider any agreement to repurchase the asset ( see paragraphs B64 – B76 ) . Performance obligations satisfied over time An entity transfers control of a good or service over time and , therefore , satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue over time , if one of the following criteria is met : ( a ) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity ’s performance as the entity performs ( see paragraphs B3 – B4 ) ; ( b ) the entity ’s performance creates or enhances an asset ( for example , work in progress ) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced ( see paragraph B5 ) ; or ( c ) the entity ’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity ( see paragraph 36 ) and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date ( see paragraph 37 ) . An asset created by an entity ’s performance does not have an alternative use to an entity if the entity is either restricted contractually from readily directing the asset for another use during the creation or enhancement of that asset or limited practically from readily directing the asset in its completed state for another use . The assessment of whether an asset has an alternative use to the entity is made at contract inception . After contract inception , an entity shall not update the assessment of the alternative use of an asset unless the parties to the contract approve a contract modification that substantively changes the performance obligation . Paragraphs B6 – B8 provide guidance for assessing whether an asset has an alternative use to an entity . An entity shall consider the terms of the contract , as well as any laws that apply to the contract , when evaluating whether it has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date in accordance with paragraph 35 ( c ) . The right to payment for performance completed to date does not need to be for a fixed amount . However , at all times throughout the duration of the contract , the entity must be entitled to an amount that at least compensates the entity for performance completed to date if the contract is terminated by the customer or another party for reasons other than the entity ’s failure to perform as promised . Paragraphs B9 – B13 provide guidance for assessing the existence and enforceability of a right to payment and whether an entity ’s right to payment would entitle the entity to be paid for its performance completed to date . Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time If a performance obligation is not satisfied over time in accordance with paragraphs 35 – 37 , an entity satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time . To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation , the entity shall consider the requirements for control in paragraphs 31 – 34 . In addition , an entity shall consider indicators of the transfer of control , which include , but are not limited to , the following : ( a ) The entity has a present right to payment for the asset — if a customer is presently obliged to pay for an asset , then that may indicate that the customer has obtained the ability to direct the use of , and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from , the asset in exchange . ( b ) The customer has legal title to the asset — legal title may indicate which party to a contract has the ability to direct the use of , and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from , an asset or to restrict the access of other entities to those benefits . Therefore , the transfer of legal title of an asset may indicate that the customer has obtained control of the asset . If an entity retains legal title solely as protection against the customer ’s failure to pay , those rights of the entity would not preclude the customer from obtaining control of an asset . ( c ) The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset — the customer ’s physical possession of an asset may indicate that the customer has the ability to direct the use of , and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from , the asset or to restrict the access of other entities to those benefits . However , physical possession may not coincide with control of an asset . For example , in some repurchase agreements and in some consignment arrangements , a customer or consignee may have physical possession of an asset that the entity controls . Conversely , in some bill-and-hold arrangements , the entity may have physical possession of an asset that the customer controls . Paragraphs B64 – B76 , B77 – B78 and B79 – B82 provide guidance on accounting for repurchase agreements , consignment arrangements and bill-and-hold arrangements , respectively . ( d ) The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset — the transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the customer may indicate that the customer has obtained the ability to direct the use of , and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from , the asset . However , when evaluating the risks and rewards of ownership of a promised asset , an entity shall exclude any risks that give rise to a separate performance obligation in addition to the performance obligation to transfer the asset . For example , an entity may have transferred control of an asset to a customer but not yet satisfied an additional performance obligation to provide maintenance services related to the transferred asset . ( e ) The customer has accepted the asset — the customer ’s acceptance of an asset may indicate that it has obtained the ability to direct the use of , and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from , the asset . To evaluate the effect of a contractual customer acceptance clause on when control of an asset is transferred , an entity shall consider the guidance in paragraphs B83 – B86.IFRS 15 Measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation For each performance obligation satisfied over time in accordance with paragraphs 35 – 37 , an entity shall recognise revenue over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation . The objective when measuring progress is to depict an entity ’s performance in transferring control of goods or services promised to a customer ( ie the satisfaction of an entity ’s performance obligation ) . An entity shall apply a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time and the entity shall apply that method consistently to similar performance obligations and in similar circumstances . At the end of each reporting period , an entity shall remeasure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation satisfied over time . Methods for measuring progress Appropriate methods of measuring progress include output methods and input methods . Paragraphs B14 – B19 provide guidance for using output methods and input methods to measure an entity ’s progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation . In determining the appropriate method for measuring progress , an entity shall consider the nature of the good or service that the entity promised to transfer to the customer . When applying a method for measuring progress , an entity shall exclude from the measure of progress any goods or services for which the entity does not transfer control to a customer . Conversely , an entity shall include in the measure of progress any goods or services for which the entity does transfer control to a customer when satisfying that performance obligation . As circumstances change over time , an entity shall update its measure of progress to reflect any changes in the outcome of the performance obligation . Such changes to an entity ’s measure of progress shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies , Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors . Reasonable measures of progress An entity shall recognise revenue for a performance obligation satisfied over time only if the entity can reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation . An entity would not be able to reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation if it lacks reliable information that would be required to apply an appropriate method of measuring progress . In some circumstances ( for example , in the early stages of a contract ) , an entity may not be able to reasonably measure the outcome of a performance obligation , but the entity expects to recover the costs incurred in satisfying the performance obligation . In those circumstances , the entity shall recognise revenue only to the extent of the costs incurred until such time that it can reasonably measure the outcome of the performance obligation .\"\n"

      "Changes in the transaction price\n",
      "Sentence: \"After contract inception , the transaction price can change for various reasons , including the resolution of uncertain events or other changes in circumstances that change the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the promised goods or services . An entity shall allocate to the performance obligations in the contract any subsequent changes in the transaction price on the same basis as at contract inception . Consequently , an entity shall not reallocate the transaction price to reflect changes in stand-alone selling prices after contract inception . Amounts allocated to a satisfied performance obligation shall be recognised as revenue , or as a reduction of revenue , in the period in which the transaction price changes . An entity shall allocate a change in the transaction price entirely to one or more , but not all , performance obligations or distinct goods or services promised in a series that forms part of a single performance obligation in accordance with paragraph 22 ( b ) only if the criteria in paragraph 85 on allocating variable consideration are met . An entity shall account for a change in the transaction price that arises as a result of a contract modification in accordance with paragraphs 18 – 21 . However , for a change in the transaction price that occurs after a contract modification , an entity shall apply paragraphs 87 – 89 to allocate the change in the transaction price in whichever of the following ways is applicable : ( a ) An entity shall allocate the change in the transaction price to the performance obligations identified in the contract before the modification if , and to the extent that , the change in the transaction price is attributable to an amount of variable consideration promised before the modification and the modification is accounted for in accordance with paragraph 21 ( a ) . ( b ) In all other cases in which the modification was not accounted for as a separate contract in accordance with paragraph 20 , an entity shall allocate the change in the transaction price to the performance obligations in the modified contract ( ie the performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied immediately after the modification ) .\" → Contract modifications (0.8284)\n",
      "Amortisation and impairment\n",
      "Sentence: \"An asset recognised in accordance with paragraph 91 or 95 shall be amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates . The asset may relate to goods or services to be transferred under a specific anticipated contract ( as described in paragraph 95 ( a )) . An entity shall update the amortisation to reflect a significant change in the entity ’s expected timing of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates . Such a change shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8 . An entity shall recognise an impairment loss in profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of an asset recognised in accordance with paragraph 91 or 95 exceeds : ( a ) the remaining amount of consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services to which the asset relates ; less ( b ) the costs that relate directly to providing those goods or services and that have not been recognised as expenses ( see paragraph 97 ) . For the purposes of applying paragraph 101 to determine the amount of consideration that an entity expects to receive , an entity shall use the principles for determining the transaction price ( except for the requirements in paragraphs 56 – 58 on constraining estimates of variable consideration ) and adjust that amount to reflect the effects of the customer ’s credit risk . Before an entity recognises an impairment loss for an asset recognised in accordance with paragraph 91 or 95 , the entity shall recognise any impairment loss for assets related to the contract that are recognised in accordance with another Standard ( for example , IAS 2 , IAS 16 and IAS 38 ) . After applying the impairment test in paragraph 101 , an entity shall include the resulting carrying amount of the asset recognised in accordance with paragraph 91 or 95 in the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs for the purpose of applying IAS 36 Impairment of Assets to that cash-generating unit . An entity shall recognise in profit or loss a reversal of some or all of an impairment loss previously recognised in accordance with paragraph 101 when the impairment conditions no longer exist or have improved . The increased carrying amount of the asset shall not exceed the amount that would have been determined ( net of amortisation ) if no impairment loss had been recognised previously .\"\n",
      "Presentation\n",
      "Sentence: \"When either party to a contract has performed , an entity shall present the contract in the statement of financial position as a contract asset or a contract liability , depending on the relationship between the entity ’s performance and the customer ’s payment . An entity shall present any unconditional rights to consideration separately as a receivable . If a customer pays consideration , or an entity has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional ( ie a receivable ) , before the entity transfers a good or service to the customer , the entity shall present the contract as a contract liability when the payment is made or the payment is due ( whichever is earlier ) . A contract liability is an entity ’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration ( or an amount of consideration is due ) from the customer . If an entity performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due , the entity shall present the contract as a contract asset , excluding any amounts presented as a receivable . A contract asset is an entity ’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer . An entity shall assess a contract asset for impairment in accordance with IFRS 9 . An impairment of a contract asset shall be measured , presented and disclosed on the same basis as a financial asset that is within the scope of IFRS 9 ( see also paragraph 113 ( b )) . A receivable is an entity ’s right to consideration that is unconditional . A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due . For example , an entity would recognise a receivable if it has a present right to payment even though that amount may be subject to refund in the future . An entity shall account for a receivable in accordance with IFRS 9 . Upon initial recognition of a receivable from a contract with a customer , any difference between the measurement of the receivable in accordance with IFRS 9 and the corresponding amount of revenue recognised shall be presented as an expense ( for example , as an impairment loss ) . This Standard uses the terms ‘ contract asset’ and ‘ contract liability’ but does not prohibit an entity from using alternative descriptions in the statement of financial position for those items . If an entity uses an alternative description for a contract asset , the entity shall provide sufficient information for a user of the financial statements to distinguish between receivables and contract assets .\"\n",
      "Disclosure\n",
      "Sentence: \"The objective of the disclosure requirements is for an entity to disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature , amount , timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers . To achieve that objective , an entity shall disclose qualitative and quantitative information about all of the following : ( a ) its contracts with customers ( see paragraphs 113 – 122 ) ; ( b ) the significant judgements , and changes in the judgements , made in applying this Standard to those contracts ( see paragraphs 123 – 126 ) ; and ( c ) any assets recognised from the costs to obtain or fulfil a contract with a customer in accordance with paragraph 91 or 95 ( see paragraphs 127 – 128 ) . An entity shall consider the level of detail necessary to satisfy the disclosure objective and how much emphasis to place on each of the various requirements . An entity shall aggregate or disaggregate disclosures so that useful information is not obscured by either the inclusion of a large amount of insignificant detail or the aggregation of items that have substantially different characteristics . An entity need not disclose information in accordance with this Standard if it has provided the information in accordance with another Standard .\"\n"
